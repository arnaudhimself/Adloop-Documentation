Notifications tell your teammates what is happening on their campaigns without having to log into Adloop #timesaver 


## 1 - What are Integrations?
It is very simple! Before we can send a Notification, it is necessary to set up an Integration. This is where the Notification will arrive to. 

We are regularly adding new Integrations, mostly they consist of instant messaging applications or simply email lists. 

To add instant messaging Integrations, you must have the corresponding access rights. If you don’t have those rights, contact your administrator within your organization.  

To add a notification, simply click on the button   in notification Integrations and choose the desired Integration in the list.
