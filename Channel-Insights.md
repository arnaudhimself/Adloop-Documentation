First you have to decide the sensitivity of the alert which will determine when the alert is triggered according to different thresholds. You can select Low/Medium/High.

You also have to select the period on which the alert will be triggered. You can select Last 7 days/Last Week/Last 14 days/Last 30 days/Last month

It’s important to not that If you choose previous year attributed data might not be available based on your personal setup. You also have the option to select both periods but in that case you will receive two separate alerts.

Lastly you have to choose between attributed data and platform data (or both). This means that whatever you choose your alert will only include that specific data.
