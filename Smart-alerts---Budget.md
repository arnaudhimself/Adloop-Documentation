 **Keeping track of sudden budget changes**  can be a challenge and that changes can go unnoticed for some time, leading to poor performances. That is why we are offering our very own solution:  **Adloop Smart Alert** !

Anytime  **your budget on a channel is changing suddenly** , you’ll receive an alert highlighting how consequent the change was as well as  **some context** on that channel.


*  How did my conversions move?


*  What about my clicks? 


* Did my CPC get more expensive or cheaper?





When you receive this alert in your mailbox, you’ll be able, in less than one minute, to  **decide if you should take action or not** .

You'll find them under the ‘Smart Alerts’ menu. 

If you already had notifications set-up, don't worry, those haven't disappeared, you'll find them in xxx.

By default,  **all users on your dataset will be subscribed**  on that smart alert. You can change that list by going into the setting of the Smart Alert Budget. Note that  **this alert cannot be deleted** .
