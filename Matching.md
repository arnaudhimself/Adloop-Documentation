The  **Matching** is associating one by one **Sources**  with  **Analytics or Attribution Sources**  in order to create relationships between all their  **Dimensions** . 

 _Note_  : If you have the Adloop Tracking & Attribution Premium option, the matching is automatic - you don’t have to do anything to match your Ad Platform dimensions & Adloop data.  **You still need to do it for your Analytics Source though** ! 

Thanks to the matching, Adloop can link Ad platforms dimensions (campaign name, keyword etc.) et Analytics dimensions (UTM). It helps marketers saving time, because they don’t have to go anymore to each platform to compare data and calculate all the ratios and KPI.
