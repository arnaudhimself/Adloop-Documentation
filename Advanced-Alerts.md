## 2 - Building Notifications in Adloop  
 **Prerequisite**  - For Notifications to work, you must have set-up:  


* One or several  **Data Sources** 


* One or several [[ **Integrations** |Integrations]]



A notification requires several elements in order to function properly: 



|  **Element**  |  **Details**  | 
|  --- |  --- | 
|  **Notification type**  | The trigger of the notification, the event that will trigger the notification sending. Notification types are chosen by the Adloop team, that can add new ones.    | 
|  **Destination**  | The app the notification will be sent to. You must have created your [[Integrations. |Integrations]] | 
|  **Source**  | The Date Source you want to be notified about. The Source defines the content of the notification. You can, in some cases, select several Sources for a Notification. You can also filter the Source to limit the scope (for example, you can select a single   **Facebook Ads** campaign). | 
|  **Métrics**  | The metrics that trigger the Notification. For example: <ul><li>if you select the   **Ad spend**  Metrics, you want a notification based on the spends of the selected Source. 

</li><li>if you select  **Conversion** , we trigger a notification based on the number of conversions coming from  **Bing Ads** 

</li></ul> | 
|  **Frequency**  | How frequently you will be receive the Notification.  | 
|  **Period**  | Period on which the metrics will be analyzed. | 
|  **Name**  | The notification name, you can choose what you want, but we advise you to be precise, because if you receive 15 notifications per day, you will be glad you named them well.   |
