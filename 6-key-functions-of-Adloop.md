### CONNECT : Everything starts with a Data Source
Adloop does not collect data directly, it feeds itself from external Data sources which are : 


* Your  **Ad platforms**  which give you data that we usually call  **_Ad-Centric_**  : Impressions, clicks, ad names, campaign types, etc.


* Your  **Analytics**  tools feeding Adloop in users behavior’s data on your sites and apps  **_(Site-Centric_**  data) : Pages viewed, add to the basket, account setup, purchase, visits demographic, etc.


* Your  **CRM**  or **business**  apps used to identify clients or prospects, communicate with them, know what they bought, etc. That is  **_User-Centric_** .





All those data are sent to Adloop via  **_API_**  data connectors which are updated automatically every 3 hours.
