You will find the list of all the dimensions available in your site. You can then select for each dimension the desired values you want to use as filters.

Only data corresponding to the filters will appear in the report.

You can use the search bar either to search for dimensions or for values (once a dimension is chosen) using the switch in the search bar:

If choosing a dimension with lots of possible values (like keyword or ad ID), the loading can be a bit long. Please be patient! Or use another dimension (like ad group or campaign)

You can now click on the Go! button and generate your report!
