The initial period is identified with the purple colour, while the comparison period is in yellow.


## 4- Filters (optionnal)
Clicking on the funnel icon opens the filters menu.

Only data corresponding to the filters will appear in the report. 

You can use the search bar either to search for dimensions or for values (once a dimension is chosen) using the switch in the search bar:

If choosing a dimension with lots of possible values (like keyword or ad ID), the loading can be a bit long. Please be patient! Or use another dimension (like ad group or campaign) 

You can now click on the Go! button and generate your report!
