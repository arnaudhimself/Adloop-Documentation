Dimensions are the names, categories or characteristics of the digital marketing campaigns. 

Each platform has its own dimensions, but some are common to many platforms, like  **campaign names** ,  **ad names** ,  **campaign objectives**  etc. 

The dimensions Picker is the first of the  **Reports**  pickers.
