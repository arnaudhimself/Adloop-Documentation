On the Data Sources page, you can see quickly all the data sources you set-up and their status.

Data-sources are separated in 3 categories: 


*  **Data-sources** : sources for which Adloop has an API connection - data is gathered automatically several times a day.


*  **Custom sources** : sources for which there is no API connection - external data is then imported by file droping, email or FTP.


*  **Organic sources** : sources for which there is no Advertising data to import.



We will explain here what is the purpose of every zone and what you can find in them:

## Area 1 :   to add a Data Source
Opens a pop-in with the available  **Data Sources**  connections. 

See the dedicated pages to  **Ad Sources**  or  **Analytics Sources**  for more information on adding Data Sources. 


## Area 2 : Data Sources already in your Dataset
 The names and logos of the  **Data Sources**  you added to your  **Dataset** .


## Area 3 : Data Sources details
You will find here the details of every Data Source you added, especially its number in the ad platform, its name but also the timezone and the currency. 

We convert currencies when we import the data in the currency you chose for the Dataset. For more information, see the [[ **Data Quality** |Data-Quality]] page. 


## Area 4 : Data Sources status
This zone is important to check the quantity and quality of the imported data. 

For each Data Source, you will find: 


* History of the data in Adloop


* Date and time of the last data import


* A small graph with the imported data over the last 14 days 



For more information about the frequency of the data import, see the [[ **Data Quality** |Data-Quality]] page. 


## Area 5 : Activate / Deactivate a Data Source 
With this switch button you can stop the data import for  **Data Source**  without deleted the imported history. 

noteThis function is interesting if you stop a contract with a partner but you want to keep a coherent data history.

## Area 6 : set-up or delete a Data Source
