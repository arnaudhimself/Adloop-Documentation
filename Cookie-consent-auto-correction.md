Having headaches lately on correcting your data to take into account the data lost due to  **cookie consent rate** ? Well, we have you covered: you’ll find this functionality directly into the tool and your data will be corrected within seconds.


# Which data do we correct?
Cookie consent affect data measurement happening on-site: number of page views, conversions, revenue and other on-site behaviours. In other words, it does not affect how much money you pay for a click on Google Search or how many reactions your Instagram ads is getting.

We collect data from 3 different types of data-sources : 


*  Advertising data-sources (Google Search, Google Perf Max, Meta etc.) 


*  Analytics data-sources (Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Piano etc.)


*  Adloop Attribution data-source (well, this one is only coming from Adloop)  



 When cookie-consent auto correction is on in your the reports, this means that the following metrics are corrected:


*  **Conversions**  and  **Revenue metrics**  coming from  **Advertising sources** . Therefore, KPI that include those metrics in their calculation, like ROAS or CPA, will be corrected as well. Metrics like Ad Spend, Clicks, Impressions, Reactions, Interactions or Completed Videos are not corrected.


*  **All metrics**  coming from  **Analytics data-sources** 


*  **All metrics**  coming from  **Adloop Attribution data-source**
