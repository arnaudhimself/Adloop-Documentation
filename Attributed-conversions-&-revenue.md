Now that you set-up your behavioural attribution model in Adloop, you see that you have new metrics in your reports :  **attributed** conversions & revenue. 

:nerd:1f913ðŸ¤“#DEEBFFThe attributed conversion/revenue is the amount of conversion/revenue that can be  **attributed to a traffic source or campaign** . It is very useful in analyzing  **return on ad spend**  and determining the  **digital marketing budgets** .

Adloop attributed conversions & revenue will differ from the one indicated by Google Analytics or by the Ad Platforms and it is  **normal** : we use our own behavioural algorithm to calculate attribution. Our attribution is behaviour-based, meaning that it takes into account the actions that the users did on your website.


## Attribution KPI
a- Cost per attributed conversion

noteAd Spend / Attributed Conversions

Ad Spend / Attributed Conversions

b- Attributed return on ad spend 

noteAttributed Revenue / Ad Spend

Attributed Revenue / Ad Spend



Use those two KPI, compare them to what the Ad Platforms say! Then you can start optimizing your digital marketing campaigns based on more reliable & more transparent metrics.
