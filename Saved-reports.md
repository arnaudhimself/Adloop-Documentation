## 2 - Reports Templates
You can start an  **Empty Report**  but also use the  **Reports Templates**  offered by Adloop, in order to open an already constructed report with  **Dimensions**  and  **Metrics**  that you can use for your specific needs. 

note **Reports Templates**  were created for specific objectives on marketing channels (SEA, Social etc.) but also to make  **Google Data Studio**  exports.
