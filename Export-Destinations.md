Exports enables you to export sets of data (built in  **Reports** ) in standart formats to applications outside Adloop. Those sets of data are automatically updated according to the chosen frequency #timesaver 


## 1 - What is an Export Destination?
Very simple! Before being able to export data, you have to define a Destination. It is the location the Export will arrive to. 

We are regularly adding new Destinations, email is the default destination. But sending data goes through Analytics apps, Data Visualisation or Datamarts. 

To add Destinations other than email, you must have the corresponding access rights. If you don’t have access to it, contact your administrator within your organization. 

To add a destination, simply click on  **+Add**  in  **Export Destinations**  and choose the desired Destination in the list.

## 2 - Available Export Destination
During the process of creating a destination, you will have to fill in a destination name. We advise you to give a precise name to each Destination you create, it will be easier later on.

To this day, the available Destinations are:
