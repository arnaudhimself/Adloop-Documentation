## Step 1.
First, You have to give a name to your conditional dimension. Give it a clear name so you can identify it easily when creating a report.


## Step 2.
You have to select a visibility. The options you can choose from are:  **Hidden, Primary, Secondary** 

Ideally, you would chose  **Primary** for those dimensions that are the most important and Secondary for those that will appear below the line.

## Step 3. 
Choose the category based on the dimensions used for the conditional dimension. The categories you can choose from are the following:  **Affiliation, Analytics, Custom, Direct, Display, Email, Retargeting, SEA, Shopping, Social Ads, Social organic, Spot TV, Video** 


## Step 4. 
You have to set the rules for each value that your dimensions will have. For example here, Facebook Ads campaigns can have one of the following objectives : Reach, Interaction, View, Traffic

You  can combine several rules for each value. For example here, there is an added rule: or facebook campaign name contains  **interaction**  in small letters. 

Then the dimension value will be, in this case, a fixed value : “ **interaction** ”.

If you want to set up additional dimension values you can, by clicking on the add a new dimension value button. 

Finally, all of your campaigns have an objective, so nothing should be left blank, but in case that happens you can put “N/A” for not available in the “else the dimension value will be” field.
