It’s important to note that Facebook uses an “estimated metric”.

An estimated metric is derived through statistical sampling or modelling, rather than a straight count. Which means that there will be differences between the data in Adloop and the source when fetching the data for more than a day.

|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  Impressions \[Account] Impressions | Impressions | Total number of times this profile has been seen within the specified period | 
|  Reach  \[Account] Reach | Instagram reach | The number of unique accounts that saw any of your posts or stories at least once. Reach is different from impressions, which may include multiple views of your posts by the same account. This metric is estimated. |  |
