Adloop imports data stocked in outside apps thanks to our  **Data Sources** . 

The Ad Sources are  **Data Sources** connected to Ad platforms. 


## Add a Data Source
Adding a Data Source, nothing simpler! In the Data Source page, you just have to click on the   button, a popin with the available connections appears.

You can search the connection by its name. 

A small label appears on some  **Data Sources** :  



| ![](images/storage/image-20210621-150945.png) | New connection | Super fresh, it has been there less than a month!  | 
| ![](images/storage/image-20210621-151020.png) | In progress | It will come rather soon. If you think it is taking too long, write to [ **support@adloop.co** ](mailto:supper@adloop.co) to speed it up!  |

## Connection types
Before connection a  **Data Source** , you must have a access rights. 

Each  **Data Source**  uses a specific connection mode, but there are 3 main types: 



|  **Connection type**  |  **Detail**  | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| Oauth | Delegation connection system. Adloop inherits reading authorisation for data.  | 
| Token API | You will have to enter an API key you got from the ad platform itself or through your account manager.  | 
| Login / Password | Simply login and password for an Adloop user you will have created in the ad platform. | 


## Dimensions and Metrics choice
Once the connection is effective, you have to choose the [[ **Dimensions** |Dimensions-in-Adloop]] and the [[ **Metrics** |Metrics-in-Adloop]] we have to get from the  **Data Source** . 

The  **default Dimensions**  or the  **default Metrics**  will be imported no matter what, because they are main elements of our reports. It is not possible to delete them. 

The  **Other dimensions**  and the  **Other metrics**  can be selected if you need them. 

noteIf you don’t find a Dimension or a Metric, ask the Adloop Support! 

If you don’t find a Dimension or a Metric, ask the Adloop Support! 


## Imported period and import frequency
Adloop imports a year of data when a  **Data Source**  is added. 

Once added, data are updated every 3 hours or 8 times a day. 

Depending on the  **Data Sources**  and the API quotas, importing a year of data can take between 2 and 72 hours. Sometimes, you have to be patient!
